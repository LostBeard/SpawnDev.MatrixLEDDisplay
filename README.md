# SpawnDev.MatrixLEDDisplay
Blazor WebAssembly code and demo app for communicating with the "Matrix LED Display" by Merkury Innovations. 

This $20 USB powered display features a 16x16 multi-color LED grid that can be found at places like Walmart [here](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Merkury-Innovations-Bluetooth-Matrix-LED-Pixel-Display/5150283693) and communicates with a phone app using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE.)

There is a big problem with this display, as one YouTube [reviewer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN0TxJoeTNk) found out... the phone-only app that is REQUIRED to control the device, does not work on most phones.

So if you bought one of these cool displays and want an alternative to the default app, this library and demo app app can help you do that.
